# Thinksy - Self Hosted

This is the open source version of [Thinksy](http://thinksy.app), A Slack App that compiles a concise list of what you‚Äôve worked on for your next daily standup, weekly update, or performance review.

If you're interested in purchasing the full self-hosted version of Thinksy that includes integrations like Asana, Google Drive, and GitHub, please contact calli@thinksy.app.

If you're looking for the cloud version of Thinksy it is available now at [thinksy.app](https://www.thinksy.app).

## Who is this for?
Software engineers, product managers, and engineering managers who need to quickly summarize work that has been accomplished in a given time period.

Normally this is done through manually searching through your Slack and documents but Thinksy helps do the search and summarization for you so you can get a quicks snapshop of what's been accomplished.

This can be useful for gathering standup notes, weekly updates, or even performance reviews.

## How does it work?
Thinksy will look at the messages you've sent in the chosen time frame and feed them into OpenAI to summarize the work you've accomplished.
